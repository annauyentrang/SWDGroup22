#Application overview
The application will be a web application. Volunteers have simple registration/login, a guided profile setup, and a dashboard that shows upcoming events they’re matched to and their participation history. Matching considers skills, preferences, availability, distance/location, and event priority/urgency. Administrators can create and manage events, define requirements and roles, view matching volunteers, and generate reports on participation and hours.

#User experience
Volunteers use a mobile-friendly web interface with three-step onboarding: register, verify email, and add profile info (location, skills, availability, preferences). After onboarding, the dashboard shows suggested events tailored to their profile, lets them check in/out, see assignments, receive notifications, and review history/hours.
Administrators can create/edit events and shifts (with skills, location, urgency), view lists of matching volunteers, manually place people into roles/shifts when needed, approve hours per event/shift, and view/export reports. Admins also see centralized volunteer records (contact info, skills, credentials, availability, locations) and can update volunteer status based on background checks, required trainings, and forms. Optional: track mileage/expenses for reimbursement with supervisor sign-off and an audit trail.
