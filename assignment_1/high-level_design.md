- User will log in. If not registered, they are prompted to input an email address, followed by email authentication. Verified users are logged in and are identified as either volunteer or admin.
- Volunteers can manage their profile, view the availability calendar, and event suggestions on the dashboard. They manage their profile through the profile management UI, from which they can update their general availability calendar, view suggested events, receive notifications, or track their hours and participation.
- Admins log in to the event management UI, where they can create and edit events, access the volunteer matching module, assign tasks, view results, and generate reports on volunteer participation.
- All information will be stored in the database, which will ensure smooth communication between both front-end and back-end.
