# Development Methodology
- We would use the Agile (Scrum) methodology, because requirements may evolve as the nonprofit refines how they want volunteers matched, and Agile supports flexibility and user feedback.
- Short sprints with reviews and demos let stakeholders (admins/volunteers) test features early and provide feedback for improvements.
- Backlog prioritization and sprint planning help manage scope within the semester, focusing first on core features (auth, profiles, events) before enhancements (history, analytics).
- Incorporating DevOps practices (CI/CD, automated testing, staging environment) ensures continuous integration, quality, and smooth deployment throughout development.
