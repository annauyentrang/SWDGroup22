# Development Methodology
- We would use Scrum/Agile, because as opposed to Waterfall, we would have constant feedback so the product would continuously be improving.
- Agile is also done in two week sprints, which we decided would be effective for managing the workflow in building the app by making the process iterative.
- Using Agile we would also be working with a new backlog at the start of each sprint, focusing on the most important features first.
- Since we're working with two user types with different demands, it would be easier to work with one group at a time.
