# Development Methodology
- We would use Scrum/Agile as a development methodology, because as opposed to Waterfall where we would receive feedback only after each phase completion, we would have constant feedback, which would facilitate the continuous improvement of the product.
- We decided that iterative, two-week sprint structure of Agile would streamline workflow management during the building of our app, enabling us to manage the project effectively.
- In the Agile development methodology, users work with a new backlog at the start of each script, focusing on the most important features first. This would allow our group to prioritize tasks effectively, assisting our group with time management.
- Given that for this assignment our group is working with two user types with different demands, it would be easier to work with one group at a time using Agile methodology
